## Information 

Again a try at Three.js for playing with scripting with JavaScript that I have learned the last couple weeks.  This time we find ourselves in another dimension flying through endless boxes.  Works as a great screen saver.  :D

#####Bugs

Can always add asteroids to replace the boxes but have not yet found a glitch.
